I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a knack for backend wizardry. I thrive on leveraging the latest tech to tackle real-world challenges. At Walmart Global Tech, I led projects to revolutionize incident mitigation and optimize anomaly detection, making life easier for teams across the board. Prior to that, I was diving deep into backend engineering, where I geeked out on enhancing systems and fine-tuning algorithms to optimize performance.

âš¡ When I am not at my desk, you can find me at the closest gym or the Soccer field, depending on how athletic I feel ðŸ˜„
